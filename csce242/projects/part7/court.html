                        The three-piece tuxedo is an elegant ensemble in a muted dusty rose color, featuring coordinated jacket, vest, and trousers adorned with intricate gold floral embroidery. The jacket showcases this beautiful embroidery throughout, with subtly rounded notch lapels and fabric-covered buttons that match the suit. It includes flap pockets on both sides and a welt chest pocket, all tailored to create a modern silhouette. The vest matches the jacket perfectly, sporting a classic V-neck cut and three buttons, adding depth and sophistication to the look. Underneath, a bright white dress shirt with a structured spread collar provides a clean contrast to the ornate tuxedo. Completing the outfit is a matching dusty rose bow tie in a satin finish. The trousers, also in dusty rose with gold embroidery, maintain a slim and tapered fit, ensuring a sharp look while allowing the embroidered details to take center stage.
