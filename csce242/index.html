                            For this assignment, we developed a visually appealing website that closely matches the mockup provided. Our primary focus was on the layout, utilizing CSS Flexbox to create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes. Additionally, we incorporated Media Queries to ensure optimal viewing experiences across various devices. As part of the project, we selected a cohesive color scheme that enhances the overall aesthetic and usability of the site.

                            We had a great time taking on the challenge of reimagining the design and functionality of the University of South Carolina's Swimming and Diving website! By diving deep into the original layout and features, we were able to capture the essence of the site while putting our own fun spin on it with our HTML and CSS code. It was a rewarding project that allowed us to blend the original style with our creativity.

                            For Assignment 07, we practiced the JavaScript skills we learned in class. The topic was fun: Ice Cream. We had to create a project where, upon clicking a div, a text message would pop up. Then, a number slider would display new text based on the user's input. Additionally, an image would appear when a button was clicked. We also had the opportunity to choose a color scheme for our project.
