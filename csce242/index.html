Our primary focus was on the layout, utilizing CSS Flexbox to create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes. Additionally, we incorporated Media Queries to ensure optimal viewing experiences across various devices. As part of the project, we selected a cohesive color scheme that enhances the overall aesthetic and usability of the site.
